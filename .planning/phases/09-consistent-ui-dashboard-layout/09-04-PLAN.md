  <name>Task 1: Visual verification of sidebar layout and all routes</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Start dev server with `npm run dev` and visually verify the following across all authenticated routes.

    What was built: Complete layout migration — sidebar navigation replaces top header, PageLayout standardizes container widths, PageHeader adds breadcrumbs to detail pages, shared LoadingSpinner and ErrorState replace per-page implementations.

    Verification checklist:
    1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
       - [ ] Left sidebar visible with "Petra" logo, Dashboard + Calendar nav items
       - [ ] Dashboard link shows active/highlighted state
       - [ ] User avatar and name in sidebar footer
       - [ ] Click user in footer — dropdown shows email and "Sign out" option
       - [ ] Content area shows project cards with proper spacing
    2. Click "Calendar" in sidebar
       - [ ] Calendar page loads with sidebar still visible
       - [ ] Calendar link now shows active state
       - [ ] Calendar filters, status chips, and grid render correctly
       - [ ] Click a pin thumbnail — right pin sidebar opens WITHOUT conflicting with left app sidebar
    3. Navigate to a project detail page (click a project card on dashboard)
       - [ ] Breadcrumbs show: Dashboard > [Project Name]
       - [ ] Click "Dashboard" in breadcrumbs — navigates back
       - [ ] Content area uses medium width (not full width)
    4. Navigate to an article detail page
       - [ ] Breadcrumbs show: Dashboard > [Article Title]
       - [ ] Content uses narrow width (good for reading)
    5. Navigate to a pin detail page
       - [ ] Breadcrumbs show: Dashboard > [Pin Title]
       - [ ] All pin actions visible (edit, delete, status, scheduling, metadata, publish)
    6. Collapse the sidebar (click the rail or trigger)
       - [ ] Sidebar collapses to icon-only mode
       - [ ] Content area expands to fill space
       - [ ] Expand sidebar again — returns to full width
    7. Check for visual issues:
       - [ ] No jarring width changes between pages
       - [ ] No overlapping elements
       - [ ] No broken scrolling
       - [ ] Sidebar stays fixed during scroll
